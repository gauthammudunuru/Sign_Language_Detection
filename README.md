# Sign_Language_Detection
The data set is taken from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet  <br>
NN_train.mlx - This file is used to train the CNN model with the data from above kaggle link  <br>
Code_Testing.mlx - This file is used to test our model with the test data set from above kaggle link  <br>
transfer_lerning_model.ipynb - This file is our extended work that interprets live sign language. We used transfer learning to acheive it.  <br>
