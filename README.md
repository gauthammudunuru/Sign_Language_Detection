# Sign_Language_Detection
1) The data set is taken from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet  <br>
2) NN_train.mlx - This file is used to train the CNN model with the data from above kaggle link  <br>
3) Code_Testing.mlx - This file is used to test our model with the test data set from above kaggle link  <br>
4) transfer-lerning-model.ipynb - This file is our extended work that interprets live sign language. We used transfer learning to acheive it.  <br>

 <br>
The following are the youtube links showing a quick demo of our project work  <br>
